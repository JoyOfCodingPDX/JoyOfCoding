class=MsoNormal>For Project 5, the plan of attack for this project is going to be submitted a little differently.  Namely because, I had sarted working on this project the day before it was assigned, and with having two full weeks, vs, one week, my POA wasn’t really known ahead of time, short of one thing in particular….a lot of reading.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>With this project being a big departure from both other projects, as well, as a completely different area of development for me, namely Android, I anticipated a fair amount reading being required.  As both the reading continued, and adaptions of those readings to “toy” type of exercises, my POA was evolving over time.  As such, I’ll present more of a diary of what has occurred to date, along with remaining times to be completed before the assignment is due.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 1 and 2<o:p></o:p></u></p><p class=MsoNormal>Read and code, the Fundamentals available at <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-training/"><span style='color:#954F72'>https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-training/</span></a>.  Specifically focusing on the 01.x series, as well as probing around in 02.x, 03x, and 04x based on interest, for example working with menus.  This was primarily due to the fact that with the Project 5 formally assigned, and a very brief intro on getting the environment setup, there was little to go on at this point.  The pre-recorded lecture material was good, however, the “Wizard” that we started with differed a lot, namely in the use of Navigation controls and Fragments, and I wanted to be sure of this before moving forward.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 3</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>With a pretty good understanding of the fundamentals 01.x, series, the focus was on working with the Android Studio and getting an “about” box to look nice, and hooked up to a menu item selection.  More time spent on reading up of things, like how to do scrolling views, images, and deeper understanding of the constraint layout manager<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 4</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Integration day.  Worked on getting the classes from Project4 copied over into the Project5 environment.  Fair amount of integration work to get things hooked up, namely in the Customer Fragment<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 5</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Refactoring the TextDump and TextParse routines to work with a multi-customer format.  Adopted something similar to very old school Win.ini files where each customer was inserted with square brackets around it, and the calls section below. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 6</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Displaying Customers in the CustomerFragment via Recycler View.  Lot of time working on understanding of the RecyclerView which is a more memory efficient version of list view, as it only instanciates View objects based on need, and recycles them vs. one big long list of views held in memory.  Likely way overkill for this project, but felt it was important to understand and personally, always try to think of performance when coding.  Reworked the Fragment, to include Total number of minutes shown per customer, as well as Date/Time ranges (min and max) for each customer.  Huge amount of work getting the Adapter class both understood and working.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 7</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Major amount of work understanding how to communicate via FragmentManager which was something new added to the SDK.  This was necessary for the “drill-down” into actual customer calls based on selecting a customer from the parent fragment.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 8</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>CallFragment design, RecylerView, and another Adapter.  Started with what was done for the CustomerFragment, but refactored and retro-fitted back for CustomerAdapter.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 9</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>File I/O time.  Until now, “seeding” data was sort of hard-coded, coming from a resource file that was creating the data during application startup.  Changed to look for actual application data store and load those results if present.  Added menu-item functionality to “add” or merge in seed data from the resource files to both help with development cycle, but decided to leave it in for submission/testing potentially benefiting.   Utilized Object serialization as a means to pass data between fragments.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 10</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Add New Call Fragment.  Day largely spent on GUI design, and usage of Components namely the Material ones (they look nicer).  Experimented with “toy” usages of date and time picker.  Plan to use these vs. Free form text entry.  <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Day 11</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Completing the Add new call fragment, with all necessary functionality. Integrating date/time pickers, form/field validation, and finally amending to the data storage once added.  If time permits, may come back to this effort for niceties like auto-suggest customer names as users type for auto-completing names of customers already present.  Would also like to “format” the phone number with –‘s as the digits are entered if possible.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><u>Days Remaining (2)</u><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Based on feed back from the professor, my design of data entry and customer selection, showed merit in not requiring a literal “search” functionality, as any of the searching that can be done, is intuitive via the GUI.  There is something said about limiting exposure to bad data coming in by restricting/enforcing it at the onset  This was again leveraged by used of date and time pickers.  <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>These remaining days will be spent initially centered around testing, namely, the asynchronous things like phone ringing etc, that can occur and making sure the data is consistent.  If time permits, well, plenty of other nice bell’s and whistles to include.  For example, a “new” Chip that would be displayed on both the Customer and Calls fragments for the newly added phone call.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Respectfully,<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>~Mark Wignall<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p></div></body></html>
