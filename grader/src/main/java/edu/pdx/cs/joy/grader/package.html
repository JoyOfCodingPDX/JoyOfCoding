<P>This package contains classes that are used to keep track of
students, grade projects, and submit assignments in CS410J.</P>

<P>When we test student code, we run a security manager to ensure that
their code does not do anything malicious and to allow us to run
multiple invocation of a <code>main</code> without the JVM exiting.
We also employ a policy file that looks like this:</P>

<PRE>
// Privileges for Dave's code and student's code

// Dave's code
grant
  codeBase "file:/u/whitlock/jars/cs410J.jar",
  codeBase "file:/u/whitlock/jars/grader.jar",
  codeBase "file:/u/whitlock/jars/xerces.jar",
  codeBase "file:/u/sjavata/classes-dave"
{
  // Let my code do anything
  permission java.security.AllPermission;

};

// Student's code
grant
  codeBase "file:/u/sjavata/classes"
{
  permission java.file.FilePermission
    "${user.home}/proj2/-", "read, write";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission
    "localhost:12345", "accept,connect,listen";
};
</PRE>

<p>A command line would look like:</p>

<PRE>
$ java -Djava.security.policy=/u/sjavata/grader.policy \
  -cp ~/classes-dave:/u/whitlock/jars/examples.jar \
  edu.pdx.cs410J.grader.TestProject0b \
  -studentClasses ~/classes whitlock
</PRE>
